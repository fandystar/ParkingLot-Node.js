| Branch  | 100  |
| Function  | 100  |
| Lines  | 100  |

- **Function coverage:** Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
- **Statement coverage:** Has each statement in the program been executed?
- **Branch coverage:** Has each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed?
- **Line coverage:** Has each executable line in the source file been executed?


**NOTE:** Code coverage is added to the jest tests (`npm test`) **((https://jestjs.io/)**.
You can see the code-coverage report in terminal as well as detailed HTML report inside `coverage/` folder.
